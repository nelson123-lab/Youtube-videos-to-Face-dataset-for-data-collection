# Youtube-videos-to-Face-dataset-for-data-collection

- The proposed solution involves utilizing a software system to download videos from YouTube by parsing a list of video links stored in a text file. Once the videos are downloaded, an algorithm will be employed to extract keyframes from each video. These keyframes will serve as representative images for further analysis.

- To extract facial data from the keyframes, a sophisticated face recognition algorithm will be applied. This algorithm will accurately identify and isolate the facial regions within the images. Subsequently, a gender-based cleaning algorithm will be implemented to remove any noise or irrelevant elements from the images, ensuring that only the facial data remains.

- The cleaning algorithm will leverage gender-specific characteristics to enhance the accuracy of the gender classification process. By employing advanced image processing techniques, the algorithm will effectively eliminate any artifacts or distractions, resulting in clean and focused facial data.

- The final output of this system will be the correct gender classification for each individual in the images. This information can be further utilized for various applications, such as demographic analysis, targeted advertising, or personalized user experiences.
